# Quantium Virtual Internship

This repository contains my submissions for the Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program hosted by Forage. The program simulates real-world data analytics tasks, focusing on customer purchasing behaviors and experimental analysis to derive actionable business insights.

## Overview

### Program Structure

The virtual experience program comprises three main tasks:

1. **Data Preparation and Customer Analytics**:  
   - **Objective**: Analyze client transaction data to identify customer purchasing behaviors and generate insights.  
   - **Deliverables**:  
     - Data cleaning and preprocessing.  
     - Analysis of purchasing patterns across different customer segments.  
     - Identification of key insights to inform business strategy.  
   - **Files**:  
     - `Task 1.ipynb`  

2. **Experimentation and Uplift Testing**:  
   - **Objective**: Evaluate the performance of trial stores with a new layout to determine the impact on sales and customer engagement.  
   - **Deliverables**:  
     - Design and implementation of uplift testing methodologies.  
     - Statistical analysis to assess the effectiveness of the trial.  
     - Recommendations based on experimental results.  
   - **Files**:  
     - `Task 2.ipynb`  

3. **Analytics and Commercial Application**:  
   - **Objective**: Synthesize findings from previous tasks to provide strategic recommendations for the client.  
   - **Deliverables**:  
     - Comprehensive report highlighting key insights.  
     - Visualizations to support data-driven decisions.  
     - Actionable recommendations for business improvement.  
   - **Files**:  
     - `Task 3.pdf` (Not included in this repository)  

### Repository Structure

- **Data Files**:  
  - `QVI_purchase_behaviour.csv`: Contains customer purchase behavior data.  
  - `QVI_transaction_data.xlsx`: Includes transaction-level data for analysis.  
  - `QVI_data.rar`: Compressed file with additional datasets.  

- **Notebooks**:  
  - `Task 1.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for Task 1 analysis.  
  - `Task 2.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for Task 2 analysis.  

- **Miscellaneous**:  
  - `.DS_Store`: System file (can be ignored).  
  - `LICENSE`: License information for the repository.  
  - `README.md`: This document.

## Dependencies

The analysis was conducted using Python 3 with the following libraries:

- `pandas`  
- `numpy`  
- `matplotlib`  
- `seaborn`  
- `scipy`  
- `sklearn`  

Ensure these packages are installed to run the Jupyter Notebooks successfully.
